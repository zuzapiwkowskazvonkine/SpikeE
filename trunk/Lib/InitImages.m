% Filename and Path store the path to the original file from which the data is coming from

% Image is the actual image data. Size is MxN where 
% M horizontal pixels
% N vertical pixels

% DataSize store the size of Image
% Size is 2

% Xposition, Yposition and Zposition are position matrix. They store the
% actual X and Y axis value for all pixels. Z is optional. X and Y can be
% space variables or any other variable that is relevant to the picture X
% and Y axis. The XLabel and YLabel has to match what is in these axis.
% Size is MxN

% Label store the text values associated with various labelling text
