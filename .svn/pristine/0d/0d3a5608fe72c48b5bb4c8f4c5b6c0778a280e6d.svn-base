% was extraced from.

% DataSize store the size of Filter
% Size is 2

% Xposition, Yposition and Zposition are space matrix. They store the
% actual position in space of all pixels. Each Movie has its own position
% matrix
% Size is MxN

% Label store the text values associated with various labelling text
